# Financial Planning Tools
We are evaluating the emergency funds for a portfolio and analyzing sotcks and bonds and cryptocurrency. Then we are creating a financial plan for retirement and using a Monte Carlo Simulation to create 500 simulations to see how our portfolio may perform, analyze the retirement portfolio and forecast the next ten years and see if it is a good decision. 

## Technologies

The project leverages Jupyter Notebook packaged with Anaconda, with the following packages:

* [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - For the command line interface, help page, and entry-point.

* [pathlib](https://github.com/nemec/pathlib) - Path manipulation library for .Net

* [csv](https://github.com/thephpleague/csv) - Csv is a library to ease parsing, writing and filtering CSV in PHP.

* [json](https://github.com/topics/json?l=python) - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a standard file format that uses text to communicate data objects to array data types. This notation makes it easy for applications to parse and generate files. JSON grew out of the need to have a real-time server-to-web browser communication.

* [MCsimulation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/montecarlosimulation.asp) - Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.
